# just-another-weather-app

Simple one page web application. It will show you the weather in your location. It is using fairly new webtechnologies such as: 
HTML5 Geolocation, 
CSS3 Flexbox and other features,
JavaScript ES6 syntax,
Fetch API

You will need an up to date webbrowser so everything works properly.
